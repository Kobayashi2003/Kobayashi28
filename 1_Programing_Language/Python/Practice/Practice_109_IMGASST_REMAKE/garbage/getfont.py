            My Heart Will Go On\n
            by Celine Dion\n
            Every night in my dreams
            I see you, I feel you
            That is how I know you go on
            Far across the distance
            And spaces between us
            You have come to show you go on
            Near, far, wherever you are
            I believe that the heart does go on
            Once more, you open the door
            And you're here in my heart
            And my heart will go on and on
            Love can touch us one time
            And last for a lifetime
            And never let go 'til we're gone
            Love was when I loved you
            One true time I'd hold to
            In my life, we'll always go on
            Near, far, wherever you are
            I believe that the heart does go on
            Once more, you open the door
            And you're here in my heart
            And my heart will go on and on
            You're here, there's nothing I fear
            And I know that my heart will go on
            We'll stay forever this way
            You are safe in my heart and
            My heart will go on and """)
