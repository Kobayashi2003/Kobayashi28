Chafa
=====

Chafa is a command-line utility that converts image data, including animated
GIFs and WebPs, into graphics formats or ANSI/Unicode character art suitable
for display in a terminal. It has broad feature support, allowing it to be
used on devices ranging from historical teleprinters to modern terminal
emulators and everything in between.

Both library and frontend tools are covered by the Lesser GPL license,
version 3 or later (LGPLv3+).

This is the Microsoft Windows build of Chafa. You should be able to move
Chafa.exe into your path (for instance, to C:\Windows\), then run cmd.exe
from the start menu. At the command prompt, try e.g. 'chafa -h'.
