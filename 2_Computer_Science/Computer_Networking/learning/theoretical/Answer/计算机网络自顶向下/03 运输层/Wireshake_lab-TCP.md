### 问题 1~2 是用 `tcp-ethereal-trace-1` 命名的 `Wireshake` 文件回答的

* 1.What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?  To answer this question, it’s probably easiest to select an HTTP message and explore the details of the TCP packet used to carry this HTTP message, using the “details of the selected packet header window” (refer to Figure 2 in the “Getting Started with Wireshark” Lab if you’re uncertain about the Wireshark windows.

* 2.What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending and receiving TCP segments for this connection? 

	> 见上图


### If you have been able to create your own trace, answer the following question: (以下分组均用宏 `tcp && ((ip.src == 192.168.1.101 && ip.dst == 128.119.245.12) || (ip.src == 128.119.245.12 && ip.dst == 192.168.1.101))` 过滤)

* 3.What is the IP address and TCP port number used by your client computer (source) to transfer the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?

### 3. TCP Basics
 
#### Answer the following questions for the TCP segments: 

* 4.What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu?  What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYN segment? 

	> ![](https://github.com/YangXiaoHei/Networking/blob/master/计算机网络自顶向下/03%20运输层/images/wl_tcp.3.png)  

* 5.What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer in reply to the SYN?  What is the value of the Acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment?  How did gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYNACK segment? 

	> ![](https://github.com/YangXiaoHei/Networking/blob/master/计算机网络自顶向下/03%20运输层/images/wl_tcp.4.png)   

* 6.What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command?  Note that in order to find the POST command, you’ll need to dig into the packet content field at the bottom of the Wireshark window, looking for a segment with a “POST” within its DATA field. 
	
	> 先找到包含 `HTTP POST` 方法名的 TCP 报文段如下图所示

	> 
	> ![](https://github.com/YangXiaoHei/Networking/blob/master/计算机网络自顶向下/03%20运输层/images/wl_tcp.6.png)  

* 7.Consider the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST as the first segment in the TCP connection. What are the sequence numbers of the first six segments in the TCP connection (including the segment containing the HTTP POST)?  At what time was each segment sent?  When was the ACK for each segment received? Given the difference between when each TCP segment was sent, and when its acknowledgement was received, what is the RTT value for each of the six segments?  What is the EstimatedRTT value (see Section 3.5.3, page 239 in text) after the receipt of each ACK?  ***Assume that the value of the EstimatedRTT is equal to the measured RTT for the first segment***, and then is computed using the EstimatedRTT equation on page 239 for all subsequent segments. 

	* **Note**: **Wireshark has a nice feature that allows you to plot the RTT for each of the TCP segments sent.  Select a TCP segment in the “listing of captured packets” window that is being sent from the client to the gaia.cs.umass.edu server.  Then select: Statistics->TCP Stream Graph->Round Trip Time Graph.**

*  **The TCP segments in the tcp-ethereal-trace-1 trace file are all less that 1460 bytes. This is because the computer on which the trace was gathered has an Ethernet card that limits the length of the maximum IP packet to 1500 bytes (40 bytes of TCP/IP header data and 1460 bytes of TCP payload). This 1500 byte value is the standard maximum length allowed by Ethernet. If your trace indicates a TCP length greater than 1500 bytes, and your computer is using an Ethernet connection, then Wireshark is reporting the wrong TCP segment length; it will likely also show only one large TCP segment rather than multiple smaller segments. Your computer is indeed probably sending multiple smaller segments, as indicated by the ACKs it receives.  This inconsistency in reported segment lengths is due to the interaction between the Ethernet driver and the Wireshark software. We recommend that if you have this inconsistency, that you perform this lab using the provided trace file.**

### 4. TCP congestion control in action

* 13.Use the Time-Sequence-Graph(Stevens) plotting tool to view the sequence number versus time plot of segments being sent from the client to the gaia.cs.umass.edu server.  Can you identify where TCP’s slowstart phase begins and ends, and where congestion avoidance takes over?  Comment on ways in which the measured data differs from the idealized behavior of TCP that we’ve studied in the text.
